# Rastercar DB seeder

A very simple and ugly database seeder for the rastercar API DB

> why not store DB on the API and therefore not duplicate the schema?

to avoid bloating the api, future test databases should be gathered from a real client dump,
also this project will be archived a few weeks into production.

## Commands

```bash
cargo r
```
